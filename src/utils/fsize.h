/*
Function fsize() to get the size of files and the number of blocks contained
in the file (for a given block size).

The function works for files already opened (and pointed by <fp_in>) and also
for files not already opened (in this case the file is identified by <filename>).

This function works on files of any size and on any operating system and on
any machine architecture. Bear in mind that for files larger than 2 GBytes the
function is very slow. Block size of FSIZE_DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE should yield
the best results in terms of execution time but it may be dependent of the
operating system and/or machine architecture/hardware.

The function returns directly the number of blocks contained in the file of
a given block size in <*the_block_size>. It also returns, indirectly, the
actual block size used in <*the_block_size>, which may be different than
the original size in <*the_block_size>. If the original value of <*the_block_size>
is smaller than FSIZE_MIN_BLOCK_SIZE then FSIZE_MIN_BLOCK_SIZE is used.
Also, if the original value of <*the_block_size> is bigger than FSIZE_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE
then FSIZE_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is used. If the original value of <*the_block_size> is
equal to 0 (zero) then FSIZE_DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE is used. Bear in mind that the last
block may have a smaller size and its value is returned in <*size_of_last_block>.

If n_blocks is the returned number of blocks then:
   total_file_size = n_blocks * <*the_block_size> + <*size_of_last_block>

Arguments:
  FILE *fp_in - a file pointer (if NULL, then the file is identified by <filename>)
  unsigned char *filename - if NULL then file must be identified by < *fp>
  unsigned long *the_block_size - this is used to pass the intended size for each block
                                  and to receive the actual block size used
  long *size_of_last_block - this is used to receive the size of the last block

This code is open source and free to use as long as the original author is identified.
